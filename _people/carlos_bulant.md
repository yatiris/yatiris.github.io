### Bio

Carlos Alberto Bulant (Carlitos) is an Assistant Researcher at CONICET and a teaching assistant at UNICEN. His research focuses on enhancing medical images with hemodynamic simulations to improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Carlos is one of the Co-Founders of [Flouit](https://www.flouit.com/), a company that integrates scientific computing and simulation-based diagnostics into daily clinical practice. Carlos graduated as a Systems Engineer from UNICEN in 2010. He then moved to Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil, where he pursued an M.Sc. in Scientific Computing (2013) and a D.Sc. in Computational Modeling (2017) at the Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica (LNCC). He currently lives in Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his beloved wife and daughter :)
