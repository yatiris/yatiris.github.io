### Bio

Santiago Vitale (Santi) is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Yatiris. His thesis focuses on introducing novel ultrasound simulation techniques to train technicians in controlled environments. He is currently investigating various ray-casting and deep learning methods to simulate abdominal ultrasound images. Santiago received a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from UNICEN in 2018 and his PhD in Computational and Industrial Mathematics in 2023. He is working with us through a research scholarship granted by CONICET.
