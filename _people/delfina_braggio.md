### Bio

Delfina Braggio (Delfi) is an Assistant Researcher at CIC-PBA. She holds a PhD in Computational and Industrial Mathematics from UNICEN (2022), which she pursued with a doctoral scholarship from CONICET. She also worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate funded by CONICET. Her research focuses on analyzing brain images from both mice and humans using VBM (Voxel-Based Morphometry) and machine learning techniques. More recently, she has started working on the characterization of cortical and subcortical brain structures using machine learning models.
