I"×<p>Private meetings are important and our lab space does not have room for private presentation quite yet.
I recently have to find the committee meeting room nearby Richards building. 
It took a while for me to find the procedure but finally got a few sources for booking the room.</p>

<p>This might be useful for lab members since some of us might need to book the room for private meeting outside the lab. 
Basically these conference rooms belongs to different departments. The closest one to our lab can be booked through 
Psychology department here: <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/room-request">https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/room-request</a></p>

<p>After booking, you can then then confirm with an email usually to Lacinda Benjamin (<code class="highlighter-rouge">lacindab@psych.upenn.edu</code>)</p>

<p>If you want to book NGG space contact Christine Clay (<code class="highlighter-rouge">cclay@pennmedicine.upenn.edu</code>)</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful!</p>
